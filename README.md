# Heros-Quest

Welcome to Hero's Quest.

In this single-player game, there are 5 levels. Your aim is to complete these levels with the Hero in 
the shortest possible time but there are obstacles in place to try and slow you down.

In each map: 
- There are 2 bullet drops. The Hero spawns with an initial 10 bullets and each bullet drop 
gives 10 more bullets. It's up to you to keep count of your bullets so you know how many you have left.

- There are multiple ladders. Only one ladder is real and this ladder will take you to the 
next level; all the other ladders are decoys and will simply waste your time.

- There are multiple enemies. There are three types of enemies: Enforcers, Grunts, and Apexes. 
These enemies will shoot bullets at you, and some bullets will deal more damage than others.

To move the Hero, first rotate your Hero to look in the direction you want to travel; this can be done by using the left or 
right arrow keys. The up and down arrow keys will move the Hero up and down with respect to the direction the Hero is facing.

Once you've completed the game, your time will be added to the leaderboard. If you have placed top 5, you will be able to see it in the window opened upon 
completion of the game.
